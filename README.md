# paint-app
This paint app is made using a python library named Tkinter. This app is really easy to use. You can choose colour of your own choice, you can change the size of brush according to your wish and you can clear you canvas. 
I used Pycharm for this project. Y ou can also use Vs Code or any other Python Compiler.
